### Overview of the Project: 

Imagine we are trying to simulate how air flows over an airplane wing or how water moves through a pipe. This is dealt with by applying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), an area that is significantly dependent on the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). And we know these equations increase exponentially in complexity with size. That is where quantum computing enters the picture.

! One such equation is called the Burgers' Equation. It is a simplified version of more complex fluid equations, but still useful for testing. 

In this challenge, we aimed to build a Quantum-enhanced PDE solver for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

### Chosen Framework and Approaches: 

    ! QTN (Quantum Tensor‑Network):
It is a method where a complex and high-dimensional fluid velocity data is broken down into simpler components using matrix product states (MPS) - pretty much shrinking enormous datasets onto a handful of qubits to simulate efficiently.

    HSE (Hydrodynamic Schrödinger Equation): 
In HSE, the dynamics of fluid flow, described using a quantum wave-function, namely the Schrödinger Equation to model fluid development.

### Tools and Techniques Used: 
PennyLane, Amazon Braket-Rigetti Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), Python.
